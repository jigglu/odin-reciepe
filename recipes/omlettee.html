        <h3>Steps to Make Omlettee</h3>

        <ol class="ol-list">
            <li>In a bowl, whisk 2-3 eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. For extra fluffiness, add a tablespoon of milk or water.</li>

            <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Pour in the eggs and let them cook for a few seconds, then gently stir while tilting the pan to spread the eggs evenly.</li>

            <li>When the eggs are mostly set, add your favorite fillings (cheese, veggies, ham, etc.) to one side. Carefully fold the omelette in half and cook for another 30 seconds. Slide it onto a plate and enjoy! 🍳😋</li>

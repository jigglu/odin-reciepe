            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika (optional)</li>

        <h5>For The Coating</h5>

        <ul class="un-list">

        <h3>Steps to Make Fried Chicken</h3>
        <ol class="ol-list">
            <li>In a bowl, mix chicken pieces, buttermilk, salt, pepper, and paprika. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for the best flavor).</li>

            <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne (if using). This will give the chicken a crispy, flavorful crust.</li>

            <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, letting excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, pressing to coat evenly. For extra crunch, dip it back into buttermilk and then coat in flour again.</li>

            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 350°F (175°C). Fry the chicken in batches, turning occasionally, for 12-15 minutes until golden brown and fully cooked (internal temp: 165°F/75°C).</li>

            <li>Remove the chicken and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with your favorite sides! 🍗🔥</li>

        <h3>Steps to Make Lasagna</h3>
        <ol class="ol-list"> 

           

            <li>In a large pan, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add chopped onions and garlic, cooking until soft. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, and seasonings. Let it simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

         

            <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and dried parsley until well combined. This will add a creamy layer to the lasagna.</li>

            

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread 1 cup of meat sauce, followed by a layer of 3 lasagna noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, topping with Parmesan cheese.</li>

            

            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>

            

            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set for perfect servings. Enjoy with garlic bread and a fresh salad! üçùüòã</li>
